# XenForo-UserTaggingImprovements

Improvements to XenForo's tagging system.

- Taggable user groups.
 - customizable icon per group (small + large).
 - membership can be viewed on the front-end.
 - user group may be private, at which point only members can tag that group.
 - permission to tag taggable groups.
 - Admin privilege to view all taggable groups.
- User group tagging supports the following:
 - User profile posts/comments.
 - Posts/Threads.
 - Reports (if Report Improvements are installed).
 - Other types supporting XenForo's user tagging will automatically support tagging user groups, but the front-end UI for auto-completing user groups will not work.
- Opt-in emails on mentioned/quoting:
 - global option to enable/disable.
 - configurable default for users on account creation.
 - permission to receive tagged emails.
- Editor integration. Copying & pasting a user group tag link is transformed into @usergroup
 - Redactor support
 - TinyMCE Quattro and its wysiwyg bbcodes support.
- user mentions can be disabled per forum per user group
